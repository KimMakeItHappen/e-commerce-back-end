# Description

Internet retail, also known as e-commerce, is the largest sector of the electronics industry, generating an estimated $29 trillion in 2019. E-commerce platforms like Shopify and WooCommerce provide a suite of services to businesses of all sizes. Due to their prevalence, understanding the fundamental architecture of these platforms will benefit you as a full-stack web developer.
Your task is to build the back end for an e-commerce site by modifying starter code. You’ll configure a working Express.js API to use Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database.
Because this application won’t be deployed, you’ll also need to provide a link to a walkthrough video that demonstrates its functionality and all of the acceptance criteria being met. You’ll need to submit a link to the video and add it to the readme of your project.

# User Story

AS A manager at an internet retail company
I WANT a back end for my e-commerce website that uses the latest technologies
SO THAT my company can compete with other e-commerce companies

# Installtion
You’ll need to use the MySQL2 and Sequelize packages to connect your Express.js API to a MySQL database and the dotenv package to use environment variables to store sensitive data.
Use the schema.sql file in the db folder to create your database with MySQL shell commands. Use environment variables to store sensitive data like your MySQL username, password, and database name.
# Usage
Log into mysql in the terminal and type: source ./db/schema.sql.

This will set up the database. Then log out of mysql. If you wish to seed the data table with test values, open the terminal and type: npm run seed.

To run the back end, open the terminal and type: node server.js
